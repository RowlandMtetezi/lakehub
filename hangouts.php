				<p>
					Join us this Saturday, May 25th 2013 from 1 PM to 5 PM at the Bottlegger's Bar and Restaurant in MegaCity Plaza (near the Knk). 
					We'll have three different options available for those who attend including:
					<ol>
						<li>Javascript, Mobile and Web Development</li>
						<li>Game Design / Game-ification and Business/Practical applications </li>
						<li>Microcontrollers</li>
					</ol>
					<ul class="thumb-list">
						<li>

						</li>
						<li>
							<img src="images/hangout2.jpg" />
						</li>
					</ul>
					These three break-out groups will be led by:
					<ol>
						<li>Simeon Obwogo</li>
						<li>James Odede</li>
						<li>Tom Denton</li>
						<li>Peter Mbari</li>
					</ol>
					Comeby to participate in one, or sit in on pieces of all three. 
					Peter will be bringing back the Arduino Mega microcontrollers and showing more practical demonstrations, and all are welcome to attend and work on their own projects, or listen in and learn from others working on their own. 
					<h3>Review of Tech Workshop # 1</h3> 
					Big thanks as well to Kahawa na Kadhalika and Bootlegger's Bar in Mega City for Hosting an incredible second Tech Workshop last weekend!
					Bootlegger's provided the great space for us to do our presentations and build the mock-up businesses covering topics such as Waste Management, County Portals, Electronic Health Records, and Crime Mapping for Security. 
					Kahawa na Kadhalika (KnK) kindly provided the event with incredible cinnamon mandazi and tea. 
					<br/>
					We're grateful for their support - and looking forward to future Tech Workshops and Hangouts at Bootleggers.
					We also were honored with a stunning presentation by Peter Mbari and his Arduino Mega Boards. 
					He demonstrated the software-hardware programming link to get a string of 9 multi-colored LEDs moving in every direction - and at least as importantly proved to us how we all have ideas for profitable business that could rely on our ability to do simple hardware programming. 
					Hope you've all had a chance to put in at least a little bit of time and curiosity into building your projects and skills and looking forward to seeing you this Saturday!
