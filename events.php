									<p>This event will be a chance for us to meet with entrepreneurs, and persons interested in technology in the Kisumu area. 
									We will have guest speakers talking about how technology can be applied in business and in our lives, and it will be a chance for you to share your idea of what you would like to see the LakeHub community become.</p>
