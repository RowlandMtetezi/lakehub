					Sun May 12th 2013, Duke Of Breeze Rooftop
					<h5>Coding, Hacking &amp; Hanging Out </h5>
				</p>
				<p>
					On Sunday May 12th, LakeHub set up on the rooftop of the Duke of Breeze in Kisumu and welcomed softeware programmers 
					and hardware hackers for trainings, videos, and collaboration. 
					Simeon Obwogo led a team through the Android software development kit (SDK) exploring the initial components of creating an app.
					At the same time Peter Mbari of Access:Energy brought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" />Arduino</a>
                    microcontroller as well as his own independently constructed microcontroller and demonstrated basic principles of hardware-based programs. 
					He showed a few different software programs that sync with microcontrollers and allow for simulations of the actual hardware within the computer. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The informal event attracted individuals interested in a wide range of programming activities. 
					The event began at 1 PM and carried on until sunset with the attendees watching videos on how to:
					<ol>
						<li>Construct jet engines</li>
						<li>Build simple websites</li>
						<li>Setting microcontroller to cause an LED to blink at varying rates</li>
					</ol>
					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqfaayoqgxo&feature=youtu.be" />Reference</a>
					This was LakeHub's first hangout, and they will continue to happen twice each month on Saturday's from 1 to 5 PM. 
					Attendees at the hangout are welcome to focus on topics ranging from:
						<ol>
							<li>Game Design</li>
							<li>Mobile Application Development</li>
							<li>Electronic Circuits</li>
						</ol>

					Sat May 4th 2013, 9am - 1pm, Duke of Breeze
					<h5>LakeHub Kisumu kicks off with Tech Workshop #0!</h5>
				</p>
				<p>
					This weekend LakeHub hosted its first formal event in the heart of Western Kenya - Kisumu City! A crew of about 25 techies - students, young professionals, and business people gathered for a half-day tech-workshop at the Duke of Breeze Hotel.
					The group broke out into parallel sessions that covered: 
					<ol>
						<li>Intro to Thinking like a Programmer</li>
						<li>Web and Mobile App Development</li>
					</ol>
					The mobile app development session was led by 3rd year Maseno 
					University computer science student James Odede, president of the University's ICT-Guild. 
					Building on Ahmed Misbah's powerpoint overview - James 
					guided an interactive session in Eclipse demonstrating the first steps 
					to create a mock-application called "mFish" and talked through the idea of how Kisumu's 
					programmers could serve local needs with locally focused applications.
					<p>
						Then the crew re-assembled for a design thinking exercise led by Maria Langat. 
						Splitting into clusters of two and three and following the format of the Stanford 
						Design School's <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/k12/wiki/c739e/">Wallet Project</a> 
						the teams designed wallets to suite the users needs of security, fashion, convenience, space, and variety.
					</p>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Perhaps most importantly the event ended in a discussion amongst the attendees of 
						what Kisumu's technology community should look like 
						<ol>
							<li>When to host events</li>
							<li>Where to have them</li>
							<li>How to grow interest in the region, provide skills, promote networking, and bring Western Kenya's talent and passion for technology to the forefront</li>
						</ol>
						There was strong enthusiasm for:
						<ol>
							<li>More events</li>
							<li>More collaboration</li> 
							<li>Future of LakeHub in Kisumu</li> 
						</ol>
